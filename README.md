# PokerAI
Reinforcement-Learning AI that plays Texas Hold'em

## Notes:
* USE A VIRTUALENV (`virtualenvwrapper`) is lit. **Python 3**
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and don't forget to add your required modules in there as well
* `git push/pull` your shit often
* Work on your own branches, make pull requests to master

## Rough Plan
* The poker environment goes in the `environment/` folder, the algorithms for the agents in `agent/`
* See pictures in Slack for a list of features that the agent expects at every step
* Not sure when (probably starting with the moment we have an MVP), we're gonna dockerize the shit out of this
