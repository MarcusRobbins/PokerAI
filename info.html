									<h2>The Idea</h2>
									<p>Inspired by DeepMind's latest achievement, AlphaGoZero, we sought to create a self teaching game network for this hackathon. We chose Texas Hold'Em Poker, as it is traditionally a game based heavily on psychology, so we were interested as to how an AI would play the game. With our plan decided, we began planning for how we would accomplish this goal.</p>

									<h2>The Planning</h2>
									<p> We decided that simply implementing an existing learning model was too easy and was at-odds with the spirit of a hackathon, so we designed our own. First we discussed the features, the values it would learn to output given a game state. We ultimately decided seven key outputs would be the minimum for a proficient poker player. Put simply, they translate to the ability to interpret how to bet, call and fold in a given situation to maximize its winnings at the end of the game. After this we went on to discuss the most innovative part of the project: the learning algorithm. </p>

								<h2>The Algorithm</h2>
									<p>One of our proudest achievements this weekend is our learning algorithm. We like to call it Darwinian Q-Learning. The algorithm works as follows: Start a simulated game with four randomly instantiated copies of our network and have the clones play against one another. Due to the stochastic nature of Q-Learning's discounted future reward algorithm, the moves of each player are slightly randomized with respect to a hyperparameter called "epsilon". The AI can evaluate these random moves in hindsight, and depending on whether they were beneficial or detrimental, adjust its playstyle accordingly. Epsilon decreases over the lifetime of the AI, as it learns to play more confidently with its own playstyle and has to rely less on accidnetally making good or bad moves. At the end of many simulated games, we take the AI who won the most games as the "fittest". We reset the environment and spawn three more copies of the "winner" and repeat the process all over.</p>

							<h2>The Hard Part</h2>
							<p>The actual implementation of everything was by far the most work intensive and overall hardest part of the project. We used a Python poker library for our simulator base, as we were sure it was easier than writing one from scratch. In hindsight, it probably would have been easier to write our own. It seemed like the technical hurdles of using this library would never cease, but in the end, we managed to neatly integrate our model. Scikitlearn and Keras also gave us some trouble, but not to the degree of this poorly documented (and in some cases poorly implemented) library. Additionally, AWS proved invaluable while weeding out the bugs of our model. Our laptop CPUs were nowehere near powerful enough to reveal the behaviors we wanted to see in a timely matter. Without the generous offerings of Amazon, we would have had a much harder time with this project.</p>

							<h2>The Endgame.</h2>
							<p>After our model was finally ridden of its cornucopia of bugs and unforeseen interactions, it was time to put the icing on the cake. In the final phase of the project, we tweaked the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance possible from our model given the timeframe. We could not have possibly exhausted the options, or have written a function to do so in the given time, however I believe that this project will remain a passion project for all of us, and we will continue to try to perfect our AI.</p>
